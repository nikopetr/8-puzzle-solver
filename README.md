# 8-puzzle-solver
Solver for the 8-puzzle problem using the following algorithms: BestFS (using Manhattan's distance as a heuristic function) , DFS and BFS.

C++ code contents :

1.A State Class which represents any state of the 8-puzzle.
2.Main Class which has the implemented algorithms and runs with an example.
